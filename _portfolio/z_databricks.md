Jake worked with data teams to design Just in Time provisioning between the enterprise SSO services and Databricks to ensure that employees have the appropriate access to different levels of data within the system. Jake provided mappings and supported the implementation of the work for the company resulting in a more automated provisioning process that allows teams to understand what is and is not appropriate to provision to their teams.
