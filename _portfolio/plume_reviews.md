Jake was the only Privacy Engineer at the organization conducting Privacy risk reviews across 16 new technologies that were introduced. These technologies included new UI/UX products, security services, data platforms, and physical IoT devices and required interfacing with development engineers, data engineers, legal, and management/executive teams. Jake managed the communication and prioritization of findings.  During this process, Jake also improved the entire InfoSec department review proceses and centralized dashboards for review status to increase self-service, transparency, and shift-level privacy and security implementations.
