Jake coordinated legal and statistical experts in having weekly implementation discussions around better implementation strategies for anonymizing data. During this time, Jake documented the various legal requirements around differential privacy, anonymization and worked with Data Engineering teams to improve the implementation of existing technology. He researched various leading theories around epsilon differential privacy and international legal precedences behind anonymization. Jake socialized changes with executive leadership to understand impacts to business and obtain buy-in for future-proofing solutions.
