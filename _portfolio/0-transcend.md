Jake conducted a review of all of the major cookie consent platforms and was responsible for selecting a new vendor, Transcend. Jake then planned and coordinated engineering resources to conduct a full consent platform replacement. The project took under two months from purchase to implementation and was completed on-schedule. Jake completed the recategorization of all cookies and validated the appropriate usage of tracking pixels and cookies with engineering teams.
